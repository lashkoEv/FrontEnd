        <h1 class="title">Red pandas are unique, important and endangered.</h1>

        <h3 class="subtitle">
          Almost 50% of the red panda`s habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas.
          Unfortunately, there may be as few as 2,500 red pandas remaining in
          the wild.
        </h3>

        <p class="subtitle">
          The red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like
          body and thick russet fur. The belly and limbs are black, and there
          are white markings on the side of the head and above its small eyes.
          Red pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals that predominantly
          stay in trees. Almost 50% of the red panda`s habitat is in the Eastern
          Himalayas. They use their long, bushy tails for balance and to cover
          themselves in winter, presumably for warmth.

        <p class="subtitle">
          The red panda is an elusive and mysterious mammal of the biodiverse
          Himalayan forests. They have also been called the "firefox", “lesser
          panda”, and “red-cat-bear”— the red panda has many nicknames.

            <p class="list__subitem">
              The red panda had been previously classified in the families
              Procyonidae (raccoons) and Ursidae (bears), however recent
              research has placed it in its own family Ailuridae, in superfamily

              Red pandas are endemic to the Himalayas in Nepal, India, Bhutan,
              Myanmar (Burma) and southern China. Red pandas inhabit the eastern
              Himalayan temperate broadleaved forest with bamboo in the
              understorey with an altitudinal range preference of 2400-3900m.

                Found in Nepal, northeastern India (West Bengal, Sikkim, western
                Arunachal Pradesh), Bhutan and southern Tibet. This was the
                first red panda to be discovered and was officially named
                Ailurus (from the Greek word ailouros, which means cat), and
                fulgens (meaning fire-colored or shining) by French zoologist
                Frédéric Cuvier in 1825 who also said it was the most beautiful

                Found in eastern Arunachal Pradesh, Myanmar and parts of China

                published a description of this different red panda that he
                named Ailurus fulgens styani, after F.W. Styan who had collected
                the specimen he was reviewing. Styan`s panda is a bit larger and
                usually more brightly colored than the Himalayan red panda.

              Adult red pandas weigh-in slightly larger than a house cat.The

              Ailurus fulgens fulgens weigh 3-4.5 kg ( 6-10 lbs) on average
              while males are usually 4.5-6.2 kg (10-14 lbs). Styani females are

              Red pandas are crepuscular, arboreal and solitary. They are most

              spending most of the day resting in trees (arboreal) conserving
              their energy. Red pandas are normally solitary creatures but come
              together in pairs in the breeding season.

          the #1 Threat
        </h3>

        <p class="subtitle">
          Rapid human population growth in the Eastern Himalayas is causing
          deforestation and the degradation and fragmentation of red panda
          habitat. In Nepal, 70 percent of red panda habitat in lies outside of
          protected areas and is fragmented into 400 small forest patches.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitle">
          Habitat is being fragmented by development projects including roads,
          hydro-projects, electric transmission lines, and mining, as well as
          settlement and agricultural conversions, and anthropogenic forest

          <p class="subtitle">
            Livestock herding is a major driver of red panda habitat
            destruction. Herders cut down trees to maintain sheds and collect
            fuelwood from the forest. Unsustainable herding practices degrade
            habitat quality as livestock graze in the forest and eat and trample
            bamboo and other red panda food species. An increasing trend toward
            dairies in red panda range has fueled the demand for fodder (bamboo)
            and firewood.

          <p class="subtitle">
            Free-roaming dogs and disease are major contributors to red panda
            mortality. Herders in red panda range have dogs that protect their
            livestock from potential predators. They also kill red pandas.
          </p>

          <p class="subtitle">
            Dogs can also spread seven species of gastrointestinal parasites to
            red pandas. The canine distemper virus, which is highly infectious
            and always fatal to red pandas, is another threat from free-roaming
            dogs. Get more information below on how we are protecting red pandas
