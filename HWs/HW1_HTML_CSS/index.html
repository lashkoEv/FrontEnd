      <p>
        Japanese cheesecake, also known as Japanese cotton cake, soufflé
        cheesecake, or jiggly cake, is a bouncy and light confection with
        similar ingredients to regular cheesecake, but of lighter and fluffier
        texture. The main difference is that Japanese cheesecake has no crust
        and the egg whites are first beaten to soft peaks before being
        incorporated into the final batter. Similar to chiffon cake but even
        airier, yet surprisingly sturdy, this sweet import has become a home
        baker hit. Impressive on its own, the jiggly cake needs no bells or
        whistles to earn new fans. A quick dust with powdered sugar is all you
        need to present this beautiful dessert.

            thoroughly mixed. The meringue will soon be thick, firm, and shiny.

            as possible in the batter. Repeat with the remaining meringue to
            form a light, airy cake batter.

            the boiling water into the roasting pan so it reaches halfway up the

            oven, with the door closed, for an additional 45 minutes. Open the
