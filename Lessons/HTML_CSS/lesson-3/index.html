        Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored,
        bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans,
        primarily due to its caffeine content. It is the most popular hot drink
        in the world.
      </p>

      <p class="main__text">
        Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted
        green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine
        particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered
        out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although
        chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented
        in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or
        already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream
        are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.

        Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied
        closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible
        evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears
        in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where
        coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to
        current methods.

      <p class="main__text">
        The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the
        Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began
        cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the
        Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. In the 20th
        century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee
        cultures around the world.
